# Crowdfundr Specs
- The smart contract is reusable; multiple projects can be registered and accept ETH concurrently.
  - Specifically, you should use the factory contract pattern.
- The goal is a preset amount of ETH.
  - This cannot be changed after a project gets created.
- Regarding contributing:
  - The contribute amount must be at least 0.01 ETH.
  - There is no upper limit.
  - Anyone can contribute to the project, including the creator.
  - One address can contribute as many times as they like.
  - No one can withdraw their funds until the project either fails or gets cancelled.
- Regarding contributer badges:
  - An address receives a badge if their total contribution is at least 1 ETH.
  - One address can receive multiple badges, but should only receive 1 badge per 1 ETH.
  - Each project should use its own NFT contract.
- If the project is not fully funded within 30 days:
  - The project goal is considered to have failed.
  - No one can contribute anymore.
  - Supporters get their money back.
  - Contributor badges are left alone. They should still be tradable.
- Once a project becomes fully funded:
  - No one else can contribute (however, the last contribution can go over the goal).
  - The creator can withdraw any amount of contributed funds.
- The creator can choose to cancel their project before the 30 days are over, which has the same effect as a project failing.

# Design Prompt
Smart contracts have a hard limit of 24kb. Crowdfundr hands out an NFT to everyone who contributes. However, consider how Kickstarter has multiple contribution tiers. How would you design your contract to support this, without creating three separate NFT contracts?

# Answer
I would use the Contract Factory Pattern to create another contract factory for NFT creation that integrates multiple tier functionality.

The NFT children instances could have specific attributes that could peform different functions based on the tiers of the individual NFT instance.


# Advanced Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
TS_NODE_FILES=true npx ts-node scripts/deploy.ts
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}'
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}' --fix
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md,ts}' --check
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md,ts}' --write
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix
```

# Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Ropsten.

In this project, copy the .env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Ropsten node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network ropsten scripts/sample-script.ts
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network ropsten DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Hello, Hardhat!"
```

# Performance optimizations

For faster runs of your tests and scripts, consider skipping ts-node's type checking by setting the environment variable `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY` to `1` in hardhat's environment. For more details see [the documentation](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html#performance-optimizations).
