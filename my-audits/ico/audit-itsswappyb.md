Overall, you've made it tough for me to point out flaws. This a a great sign. I like the way you've structured everthing and remained consistent with your code. Also, it looks like you've done well with Foundry. Appreciate being vicariously exposed to this. I'll have to give it a go soon.

That being said, there were a few things I noted that may not be actual issues if we're strictly abiding by the project specifcation, but would be issues otherwise.


## **[H-1]** No receive function

Between lines 228 to 239, Ico.sol has the following code:

    function contribute() external payable canContribute(msg.sender, msg.value) {
        totalContributions += msg.value;
        emit Contribution(msg.sender, msg.value, phase);

        // To save gas, only track contributions before the open phase.
        if (phase != Phase.Open) {
        unconvertedContributions[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        } else {
        // In open phase, just directly transfer tokens.
        require(spaceCoin.transfer(msg.sender, msg.value * 5));
        }
    }

The contribute function itself doesn't seem to have any issues, however, consider what happens if someone sends ether without calling the `contribute`  function.

Consider: Add a `receive` function that calls the `contribute` function.


## **[H-2]** No withdraw function

It's not exactly specified in the spec, but there is no way to withdraw funds that have been contributed. This implies that the funds are locked in the contract and they can be only be retrieved through a mechanism such as `selfdestruct` , which is not ideal.

Consider: Add a withdraw function to withdraw contributions.


## **[Q-1]** Can override one function instead of both

On lines 96 and 103, SpaceCoin.sol has the following code:

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        uint256 postTaxAmount = handleTax(msg.sender, amount);
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, postTaxAmount);
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) public override returns (bool) {
        _spendAllowance(from, msg.sender, amount);

        uint256 postTaxAmount = handleTax(from, amount);
        _transfer(from, to, postTaxAmount);

        return true;
    }

The there is some redundancy when you override two functions - `transfer` and `transferFrom`. This would be unnecessary if you just overrided the `_transfer` function instead.

Consider: Override the `_transfer` function.
